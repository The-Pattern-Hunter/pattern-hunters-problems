Expand Rajesh's model to include multiple factors:

Complete dataset (20 days):

Temperature (¬∞C)
Day of week (1=Monday, 7=Sunday)
Weather (Sunny=0, Cloudy=1, Rainy=2)
Sales (‚Çπ)
Day	Temp	DayOfWeek	Weather	Sales

Problem 2.7: Model Limitations and Real-World Constraints
Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Challenging
Time: 30 minutes
Skills: Critical thinking, model interpretation

Rajesh wants to use your model to decide how much milk to order. Your model predicts:

At 20¬∞C: Sales = 1546 - 30.5(20) = ‚Çπ936
At 45¬∞C: Sales = 1546 - 30.5(45) = ‚Çπ174
Critical Analysis Questions: a) Is the 20¬∞C prediction reasonable? (Note: Odisha rarely sees 20¬∞C in summer)
b) Is the 45¬∞C prediction realistic? (What are minimum sales even on hottest days?)
c) Identify at least 3 limitations of extrapolating beyond data range
d) Propose minimum and maximum bounds for the model
e) How would you advise Rajesh to use this model safely?
f) What happens to model reliability as you move away from mean temperature?

Scenario: Babulal (traditional farmer) and Dr. Sharma (meteorologist) both predict monsoon arrival:

Babulal's indicators (collected over 30 years):

Peacock calls in morning: Yes/No

Tree flowering: Early/On-time/Late
Wind direction: East/West/Variable
Dr. Sharma's model (based on satellite data):

Sea surface temperature: ¬∞C
Atmospheric pressure: mb
Wind speed: km/h
Historical monsoon dates: Dates
Both predict monsoon for June 8th. Actual arrival: June 6th.

Questions: a) Both were off by 2 days. Does this mean both models are equally good?
b) List 3 advantages of Babulal's approach
c) List 3 advantages of Dr. Sharma's approach
d) How could you combine both approaches?
e) Design an experiment to test which indicators (traditional or modern) are most reliable

g) Which model would you trust more for:

Next week's prediction?
Next year's prediction?
10-year climate trend?
Reflection: This problem has no single right answer - it's about thinking deeply!
