# Chapter 1: The World as a Puzzle
## Pattern Recognition in Biology and Daily Life

---

## 📚 Chapter Overview

This chapter introduces the fundamental skill of pattern recognition as the foundation of scientific thinking. Through examples from everyday life—tea stalls, monsoon prediction, market vendors—you'll discover that you already think like a scientist.

**Key Concepts:**
- Pattern recognition in daily observations
- Distinguishing correlation from causation
- Understanding complex systems and emergence
- The scientific method as organized curiosity
- Building simple predictive models

**From the Book:** Pages 1-24 | Figures 1.5, 1.6

## 💡 How to Use These Resources

### For Self-Study:
1. **Read Chapter 1** in the book first
2. **Attempt problems** on your own (don't peek at solutions!)
3. **Check solutions** only after trying
4. **Review explanations** to deepen understanding
5. **Try coding challenges** if you want hands-on practice

### For Instructors:
- Use problems as homework assignments (5-8 points each)
- Assign 1-2 easy + 1 medium + 1 challenging per week
- Problem 1.5 works well as a semester-long project
- Coding challenges suitable for lab sessions

### Suggested Timeline:
- **Week 1:** Problems 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 (easy set)
- **Week 2:** Problems 1.4, 1.6 (medium applications)
- **Week 3:** Problems 1.7, 1.8 (challenging analysis)
- **Ongoing:** Problem 1.5 (personal pattern study)

## 📈 Self-Assessment

After completing these problems, ask yourself:

- ✅ Can I give three examples of patterns from my daily life?
- ✅ Can I explain why correlation ≠ causation with examples?
- ✅ Do I understand emergence and complex systems?
- ✅ Can I build a simple linear model from data?
- ✅ Do I know when to trust a pattern vs. question it?

If you answered "yes" to most, you're ready for Chapter 2!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

**Academic Integrity:**
- Attempt problems yourself first
- Solutions are for learning, not copying
- Discuss approaches, but write your own answers
- Cite sources if you use external help

**Datasets:**
- All data is for educational use only
- Some datasets are simplified for teaching
- Real-world data is messier - that's okay!
