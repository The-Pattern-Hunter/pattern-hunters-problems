**Skills:** Self-observation, data collection, model building

**Your Task:** Design your own pattern recognition study:

**Day 1-2:** Choose a daily decision you make (sleep time, social media use, study hours, meal timing)  

**Day 3-7:** Collect data on:
- Your decision/behavior
- Factors you consider
- Outcomes you observe

**Day 8:** Analyze your data:
- What patterns emerged?
- Can you predict your behavior?
- What factors matter most?

**Submit:**
- Data table (5-7 days)
- Pattern analysis (200 words)
- Testable hypothesis
- Proposed improvements to your model

**Learning Goals:** Apply scientific method to personal life, build predictive models

### Problem 1.6: Complex Systems and Emergence
**Difficulty:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium  
**Time:** 30 minutes  
**Skills:** Systems thinking, emergence concepts

Consider three scenarios:

**Scenario A:** Individual ants follow simple rules (follow pheromone trails, avoid obstacles). Yet ant colonies exhibit complex behaviors like farming, warfare, and architecture.

**Scenario B:** Individual brain neurons fire based on simple electrical thresholds. Yet consciousness, memory, and creativity emerge.

**Scenario C:** Individual students choosing courses based on interest. Yet university enrollment patterns become predictable.

**Questions:**
a) What is "emergence"? Define in your own words.  
b) For each scenario, identify: (i) simple rules, (ii) emergent behavior  
c) Give one biological example of emergence not listed above  
d) Why can't we predict emergent behavior from individual rules alone?  
e) How does this relate to chaos theory and sensitive dependence?

**Learning Goals:** Understand emergence, complex systems, unpredictability

**Time:** 60 minutes  
**Skills:** Scientific reasoning, hypothesis testing, experimental design

- No common workplace or social connections found
- Symptoms started 3-5 days apart
- Local population: ~5,000 people

b) List 5 possible explanations (biological, environmental, random)  
c) Design an investigation: What data would you collect? What order?  
d) How would you distinguish between:
   - Infectious outbreak
   - Environmental exposure
   - Random cluster
e) At what point would you alert public health authorities?
