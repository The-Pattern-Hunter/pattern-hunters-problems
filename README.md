## 🎓 About the Book

### *The Pattern Hunters: The Art of Scientific Thinking*

This book teaches mathematical biology through a unique approach: starting from everyday pattern recognition (tea stall predictions, market dynamics, monsoon forecasting) and building systematically to advanced concepts in:

- Population genetics and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
- Differential equations for ecological modeling  
- Stochastic processes and genetic drift
- Network theory in biological systems
- Conservation mathematics
- Evolutionary epidemiology

**What makes this book different:**
- Rooted in Indian examples and contexts
- Emphasizes intuition before formalism
- Connects daily life observations to mathematical principles
- Practical applications to real conservation problems
- Accessible to students without advanced math backgrounds

**Perfect for:**
- Undergraduate biology students
- Graduate students needing quantitative skills
- Researchers in ecology and conservation
- Anyone curious about mathematical thinking in biology
